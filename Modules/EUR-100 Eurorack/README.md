# EUR-100 Eurorack

3D-printed Eurorack case. The design is parametric for easy scaling.

The case is designed for internal brackets but could easily be adapted to use bolts that go through the sides of the case. Prints in one piece without supports.

Parts:
- [TipTop Z-rails](https://tiptopaudio.com/z-rails/)
- [TipTop Z-rails brackets](https://tiptopaudio.com/z-rails-brackets/)

Example setup with instrument input, effects, and line level output.
