# EUR-100 Eurorack

![EUR-100 Case Bottom](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b3c6b9-7f3e-4651-98c1-89feb091c19e)

3D-printed Eurorack case with metal rails. The design is parametric for easy scaling.

The case is designed for internal brackets but could easily be adapted to use bolts that go through the sides of the case. Prints in one piece without supports. The threads for the bolts are printed into the case.

Parts:
- [TipTop Z-rails](https://tiptopaudio.com/z-rails/)
- [TipTop Z-rails brackets](https://tiptopaudio.com/z-rails-brackets/)

Example setup with instrument input, effects, and line level output.
